## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Learned how to adjust footer to bottom while being the display property being defined as flex.
- Learned how to use Figma and using figma design to convert it into design using CSS

```css
body {
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
}
footer {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 5px;
}
```

- Will try to get better solution for similiar cases with good solution.
